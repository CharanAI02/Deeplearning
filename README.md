The Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card is a significant document that is used as identification for many tasks, including tax payment and as a means of verification in businesses, banks, and other government agencies in India.

However, as the demand for PAN Cards has grown, fraudulent activities involving fake PAN Cards have also increased. 

Online KYC procedures involve verifying individuals' identities remotely through digital platforms, and the PAN Card plays a significant role in this verification process.

The inclusion of PAN Card tampering detection in online KYC procedures is crucial to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the verification process. 

◉ This project proposes a two-level authentication system for identity verification.
◉ The first level involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare features and identify
individuals.
◉ The second level utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the PAN card number from the PAN
card and match it with a database.
Technologies used: Python, Deep Learning Model CNN and OCR method.
